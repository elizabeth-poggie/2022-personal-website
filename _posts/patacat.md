## Inspiration 

Pat-a-cat was inspired when Aidon Lebar said "all i want to do is pet cats" and from there started a story of heroism as David Lougheed, Allan Wang, and Elizabeth Poggie made it happen. In the corners of McHacks you could witness the cats being drawn, meows being recorded, and code being coded.

## What it Does

It does exactly what you think it does. You pat cats. In this game you can compete against your friends to pat as many cats as you can using keyboard controls. This is designed to help you relax to some lofi hip hop beats and pat some cats to break from the stress of everyday life. Once a cat is patted, you get to listen to the happy meows of hackers, sponsors, and coordinators of McHacks.

## My Contribution

I made the fonts, graphic art, and contributed to gathering the meows from the particpants. Not much coding on my end but was here to optimize aesthetics. In the end we won best design so I am proud to have done my job :)
