## My Contribution

I developed and delivered frontend solutions impacting all students in the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences creating initiatives that are still being extended today. In my time as lead I successfully strengthened our brand identity, created maintanable code, and fostered an inclusive space for everyone to thrive in.

## CTF's Main Website

The Club's main website powered by Jekyll and Bootstrap. [See it still alive here](https://ctf.science.mcgill.ca/)
