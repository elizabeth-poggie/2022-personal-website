# Poggie's Passion for Arguing

Used only for hills to die on, otherwise disagree & commit. You cannot win every conversation. What matters is winning the ones that count :^)

# Key Lessons

## The Target Audience

## Creating the Dynamic of Agreement

## Pacing

## Labeling

## Tone
Use your own name to make yourself a real person. Humor and humanity are the best ways to break the ice and remove roadblocks.

## Building Rapport
We fear what's different & that we do not understand and are drawn to what's similar. Mirroring is the art of insinuating similarity & faciliate bonding.

## Mastering No

How to never be ignored:
- Have you given up on **blah blah**?

Mislabling their emotion to trigger correction:
- My name is **BLAH BLAH** and when **POGGIE** highlights development overlap I ignore **POGGIE**.
- Do you want to be known as someone that does not fullfil agreements?
- Do you want to be known as someone that tollerates this behaviour?

Removing unspoken barieries:
- Are you saying I misled you?
- Are you saying I failed you?

## Giving Control
Calibrated questions to bypass the ego. Some examples:
- What do you mean?
- How am I supposed to to that?
- How am I supposed to accept that?
- How is this going to affect all those involved?
- What about this is important to you?
- How can I help make this better for you?
- How would you like me to proceed?
- What is it that brought us into this situation?
- How can we solve this problem?
- What's the objective?

## Guarantee Execution
Using "How" questions is a gentler version of "No"

## Leverage
- **Positive:** The ability to give someone what they want. When someone responds with "I want..." you have positive leverage
- **Negative:** The ability to hurt someone.  Direct threats shut down the negotiation and even subtle ones are risky. If you need to use this form of leverage then hit them with: "It seems like you do not care what position you are leaving me in." as a subtle tactic.
- **Normative:** If you can show inconsitencies between their beliefs and actions, you have normative leverage. No one wants to be seen as a Hypocrite.
