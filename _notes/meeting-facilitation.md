## Setting up the Conversation 
Explain the process by describing the steps below. Reiterate the goal or challenge being addressed to make sure that the context is the same for all. 

## Driving the Conversation
Pros & Cons list of different proposed solutions, otherwise people run in circles

## Selecting a solution
1. What solution has the Pro with the greatest weight?
2. What is the most enlightened solution?
3. Which one is like “good enough” for the business case?

## Grounding the conversation
1. Explain the concept to me like I am 5
2. If 2 people seem to be dominating the discussion, mediate it by calling on someone new to ask for their perspective
3. If the topic starts getting bland/off topic, anchor it back to the topic with more on your
own perspective

2. Practice asking for what functions and/or individuals need
3. Learn how to give clear answers to requests
4. Reestablish and/or improve communication inside functional clusters

6. Mend connections that have been broken
7. Get all the issues out on the table at the same time for everyone to see
8. Reduce frustration by eliminating preconceptions and rumors
