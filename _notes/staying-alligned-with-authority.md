## Getting in the Room
- Bring something useful to the room that the room does not already have
- Have a sponsor in the room.

## Staying in the Room
- **Stay aligned with your manager:** The manager will likely yield their own seat to you and stop attending.
- **Optimize for the group:** Builds trust and confidence in your judgement.
- **Speak clearly and concisely:** It’s your obligation to be understood, not the obligation of everyone else to understand you.
- **Be low friction:** If you’re known as someone who can navigate difficult conversations effectively, you’re much more likely to be involved.
- **Come prepared:** You’ll stand out if you take the time to organize your thoughts before each meeting. 

## Risking Ejection from the Room
- **Misunderstanding the Room’s Purpose:** You’ll create friction if you attempt to use a room against the existing group’s intent.
- **Being Dogmatic:** If you’re dogmatic, you will create friction that slows down discussion and impedes the group’s ability to make progress.
- **Withholding Consent:** Effective groups are formed from individuals who are willing to disagree and commit. *You can often force a group towards your perspective by withholding your consent until thinking moves your way*, but the group’s pace will slow to a halt and you’ll likely get removed from it.
- **Sucking the Oxygen out of the Room:** Usually this comes from an urge to show value, but remember that you’re in the room because of what got you into the room, not in the hopes that enter the room will magically transform you into someone entirely new.
- **Embarrassing your Sponsor:** Remember that you got into a room because someone in the room advocated for your inclusion.

## Alignment
- **Organizational Authority:** Retaining organizational authority depends on remaining deeply aligned with the bestowing sponsor, generally your direct manager.
- **Never Surprise your Manager:** Nothing destroys trust faster than surprising your manager. A manager is a juggler and surprises threaten the juggler’s rhythm
- **Don’t let your Sponsor Surprise You:** Most folks have extremely high expectations of their managers, assuming for example that they will always remember to relay information relevant to your current work. 
- **Feed your Manager Context:** If the first step is avoiding personally surprising your manager, the next step is to help your manager not get surprised by the wide organization

## Influence
- I recommend sharpening your awareness of the value distinctions between those that you hold and those that the organization operates under, and find a way to advocate for them without getting kicked out of the room.
- You’ll be able to influence your organization leaders immensely over time, but you’ll only get that time if you learn to remain in tight alignment at each step along the way.

## Self Ejection from the Room
- You’ll be most impactful if you’re selective on which rooms you stay in. I’ve never met anyone who regrets leaving a room too soon. If any given room doesn’t feel useful, exit the room.
