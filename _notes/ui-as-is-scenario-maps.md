## Purpose

build a better understanding of our user's current experience in order to determine areas of improvement. 

## When to use this activity?

you use this to uncover what the team collectively knows or doesn't know about the current experience. It is also really helpful when we need to make sense of research data

## Duration

this takes around 30 minutes to do.

## Workflow

1. Write before you talk. It's important to sketch out your ideas before hand so that during the discussion only the main points are captured
2. Stay focused on your users. To do this, you tell stories about the users so they remain the centre of your attention
3. Everyone participates
4. Designate "off topic ideas" to a parking lot section
5. Start on time and stay on time
6. Do not dismiss the ideas of the teammates, instead push yourself to build on them
7. **Overall flow**: start big, diverge to get everyone's ideas. Come back together. Discuss, cluster, and seek patterns. Then converge to discuss the strongest ideas.

## 1. Setup

## 2. Brainstorm

Ask these types of questions to fill out the table:

- What is the user doing?
- What is the user thinking?
- What is the user feeling throughout their experience?

## 3. Review and cluster

cluster similar sticky notes, refine to order, and draw rough columns that represent the unique phases of the user's current experience. 

Name these phases so that they are clear.

## 4. Identify Highs and Lows

Circle the areas that are particularly positive or negative for the user. Blank areas are for where you still need to learn more. 

## 5. Playback

Choose a user to present the map to and ask them:

1. What areas are you certain are true?
2. Where are there still gaps in the team's knowledge?

## Prior

- interviews with 2 or 3 peoples individually that use that app to get understanding for whats important for users and areas of improvement. Then do the as is map.
- Research to inform your own decisions about what to focus on.
- business vs user importance

## After

- talk about map with the rest of the team and senior lads. outside help important incase u miss something
- now u can start figmas
- complex problems need user flow diagram. then u go into mock ups
- if its a simple problem, then u go straight to mock ups.
