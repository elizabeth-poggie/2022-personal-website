# Principals

## Disagree & Commit
Disagree and commit is a management principle which states that individuals are allowed to disagree while a decision is being made, but that once a decision has been made, everybody must commit to it. Disagree and commit is a method of avoiding the consensus trap, in which the lack of consensus leads to inaction.

## Customer Obsession
Keep customer trust.

## Ownership
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They never say “that’s not my job."

## Invent and Simplify
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere.

## Are Right, A Lot
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

## Learn and Be Curious
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves.

## Hire and Develop the Best
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization.

## Insist on the Highest Standards
Leaders have relentlessly high standards.

## Think Big
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results.

## Bias for Action
Speed matters in business. We value calculated risk taking. 

## Frugality
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention.

## Earn Trust
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing.

## Dive Deep
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.

## Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

## Deliver Results
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion.

## Strive to be Earth's Best Employer
Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun.
