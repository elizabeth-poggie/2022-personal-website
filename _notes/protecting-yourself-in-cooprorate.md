## Business Focused Approach
What are your priorities and dow do these priorities loop back to the company?

## Managing Upwards
Think upwards. If you help person X, person X helps you.

## Collective Problem Solving
The leader takes the fall, so how can you turn everything into a collective discussion?

## Setting Boundaries
Take a step back. A reaction is NOT a response. Create a wall so they can't get in.

## Politics
Superseed politics with performance. Be good at doing your job so no one can touch you.

## Pick your battles
Think about where your energy is going, is this energy going to self preservation? If not, do not engage.

## Paper Trails
Write everything down. Do not let anyone rewrite history on you.

## Coping
Whatever works best for you lol, ur gonna need it lmao.
