## Business Focused Approach
What are your priorities and dow do these priorities loop back to the company?

## Managing Upwards
Think upwards. If you help person X, person X helps you.

## Collective Problem Solving
The leader takes the fall, so how can you turn everything into a collective discussion?

## Setting Boundaries
Take a step back. A reaction is NOT a response. Create a wall so they can't get in.

## Hills to Die on
Figure out what motivates you, this will help you will determine which hills are worth dying on vs not.

## Politics
Superseed politics with performance. Be good at doing your job so no one can touch you.

## Pick your Battles
Think about where your energy is going, is this energy going towards self preservation? Is this something you can control? If not, do not engage. When you can't control things, control your response.

## Paper Trails
Write everything down. Do not let anyone rewrite history on you.

## Taking it Personally
When someone is stinky, let them be. It's a reflection on them not on you.

## Coping
Whatever works best for you lol, ur gonna need it lmao.
