## Backlog
1. Rigorously identify, expand on, and define the issues at hand.
2. For each issue, ensure that a priority, effort estimate, and ownership is assigned.
3. Work with the team to define the scope & time box the work

## Time Boxing
1. Time boxing: Do not spend too long on a particular issue. Define an estimated time to complete a task X and mark that as the cut off point. After X time has passed, search for feedback. Keep in mind: What are you going to do is issues occur after X time has passed and what is happening after the first release.
2. Effort & priority metric is used to categorize the prioritization of issues.

## Building PM Trust
The quicker you do things that are high impact right away, the quicker you build trust. As well, you need to be clear about risk assessment for trust to work.

## Questions to Guide the Selling of Initiatives
1. What are the quantifiable metrics of improvement?
2. What is the meaningful impact of the motion?
3. How do we demonstrate the magnitude of the work is proportional to the magnitude of the impact? (e.g. Will this even pay off? Is it worth the time and effort?)
4. How much time/effort is this going to take?
5. What is the risk associated with the input and output of the motion? For example, will it
actually take the time allocated to the task or will it take longer? What happens if the task balloons & other edge cases along the way after the allocated time is exceeded. We can not necessarily pivot once we start along a particular path.
6. How can we be sure if we address these issues, we won't run into even more problems later down the line?
7. At what point do things stop sucking? What is the first milestone where we start seeing a difference? (e.g. whatâ€™s the first version of initiatives where we can get feedback and make decisions to pivot afterwards)
