# Poggie's Passion for Arguing

## Main Points
- It's about the target audience.
- Used only for hills to die on, otherwise disagree & commit. You cannot win every conversation. What matters is winning the ones that count :^)

# Key Lessons

## Mastering No

### Examples
- Have you given up on **blah blah**?
- Mislabling their emotion to trigger correction: my name is **BLAH BLAH** and when **POGGIE** highlights development overlap I ignore **POGGIE**.


## Giving Control

### Examples
- How am I supposed to to that?
- What about this is Important to you?
- How can I help make this better for you?
- How would you like me to proceed?
- What is it that brought us into this situation?
- How can we solve this problem?
- What's the objective?

## Mirroring

## Labeling

## That's Fair
