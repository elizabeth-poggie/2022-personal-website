# Poggie's Passion for Arguing

Used only for hills to die on, otherwise disagree & commit. You cannot win every conversation. What matters is winning the ones that count :^)

# Key Lessons

## The Target Audience

## Pacing

## Labeling

## Tone

## Mirroring
We fear what's different & that we do not understand and are drawn to what's similar. Mirroring is the art of insinuating similarity & faciliate bonding

## Mastering No

This is where all contructive negotations begin. Some examples:
- Have you given up on **blah blah**?
- Mislabling their emotion to trigger correction:
    - "my name is **BLAH BLAH** and when **POGGIE** highlights development overlap I ignore **POGGIE**."
    - if person X suggests X, suggest Y

## Giving Control
Calibrated questions to bypass the ego. Some examples:
- What do you mean?
- How am I supposed to to that?
- What about this is important to you?
- How can I help make this better for you?
- How would you like me to proceed?
- What is it that brought us into this situation?
- How can we solve this problem?
- What's the objective?

## That's Fair
